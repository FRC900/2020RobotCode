Keras install issues : 

Not enough space in /tmp to install numpy, scipy - added external drive, set TMPDIR=/mnt 
Not enough memory to build, need usb drive as swap

opkg install git gcc-symlinks binutils swig libjpeg-dev g++ g++-symlinks 

mount external USB drive
cd /mnt
wget https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/archive/v1.15.2.tar.gz
tar -xzf v1.15.2.tar.gz
edit tensorflow-1.15.2/tensorflow/lite/tools/make/download_dependencies.sh,
	 comment out the find line (busybox find isn't happy with the command)
cd tensorflow-1.15.2/tensorflow/lite/tools/pip_package

PYTHON=python ./build_pip_package.sh

Look for results in /tmp/tflite_pip/python/dist/tflite_runtime*
